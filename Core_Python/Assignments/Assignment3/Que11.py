##according to the given condition:
##For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
##For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
##For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
##For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit
##An additional surcharge of 20% is added to the bill

units = float(input("Enter electricity units consumed: "))

bill = 0
if units <= 50:
    bill = units * 0.50

elif units <= 150:
    bill = (50*0.50)+(units-50)*0.75

elif units<=250:
    bill =(50*0.50)+(100*0.75)+(units-150)*1.20
else:
    bill=(50*0.50)+(100*0.75)+(100*1.20)+(units-250)*1.50
surcharge = bill * 0.20
total_bill = bill + surcharge
print("Base Bill Amount =", bill)
print("Surcharge (20%) =", surcharge)
print("Total Electricity Bill =", total_bill)
